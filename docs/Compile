To compile this project, you need to follow some steps:

First, open the terminal and use the CD command to go to the src page:
cd "C:\project_local_source\src"

Then, compile all Java files using the correct path:
javac -d out -sourcepath . main/java/com/application/Main.java

If you have multiple Java files, you can compile them all at once by specifying the root directory: (worked)
javac -d out -sourcepath . main/java/com/application/Main.java main/java/com/model/Usuario.java main/java/com/model/dao/UsuarioDAO.java main/java/com/util/ConexaoMySQL.java

Alternatively, you can use a wildcard to compile all Java files in the src directory:
javac -d out -sourcepath . main/java/**/*.java

After compiling, you can run your Main class using the java command:
java -cp out com.application.Main
